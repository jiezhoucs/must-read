### Category and Keywords
**sandboxing**, **memory safety**, **Firefox**

### What problem does this paper try to solve?
To sandbox untrusted third-party library code from Firefox renderer.

This paper first summarizes common pitfalls of retrofitting protection to
renderer-library interfaces.

#### Insecure data flow
**Failing to sanitize data.** Data originating from libraries or shared data
accessed by libs should not be trusted and therefore should be sanitized
before use.

**Missing pointer swizzles.** Some sandboxing mechanisms, such as NaCL and WASM,
use alternative pointer representations. Renderer needs to translate or
*swizzle* pointers to and from a target representation when passing them across
the sandbox boundary.

**Leaking pointers.** Leaking renderer pointers to libs may render the system's
ASLR vulnerable.

**Double fetch bugs.** In a concurrent environment, lib code may modify a shared
value after the renderer has checked it before use.

#### Insecure control flow

**Corrupted callback state.** Attackers may corrupt function pointers saved by
renderer and use them to hijack control flow.

**Unexpected callback invocations.** Malicious libs may exploit `longjmp()` and
`setjmp()` to invoke callback functions at unexpected time.

**Callback state exchange attacks.** In a multithreading environment, a
malicious library thread may abusing objects (such as supplying the same object
to different renderer threads while two different objects are expected),
causing UAF or data race.

### What is this paper's solution to the problem?

> RLBox makes data and control flow at the renderer-sandbox interface explicit
through its type system and APIs in order to mediate these flows and enforce
security checks across the trust boundary.

#### Data Flow Safety
All data originating from sandboxed code or shared data accessed by sandbox code
are **tainted**. RLBox distinguishes pointers to renderer memory from pointers
to sandbox memory at the type level (`tainted` or not). Taint can be removed
from a data by validating it.

##### Data flow into the renderer
Mainly two types:
- return value from lib functions
- parameters passed to callback functions from lib to renderer

Programmers need to manually rewrite lib function calls to use RLBox's API
`sandbox_invoke()` and define return type as `tainted`.

Also, data can flow from a sandbox to the renderer via a pointer to the
sandboxed memory. These pointers and the pointed memory need to be `tainted`.
Tainted pointers are restricted to point to sandbox memory.

##### Data flow into the sandbox
Data from the renderer to a sandbox must be either a simple numeric type or a
`tainted` type. Tainted memory should be allocated in a sandbox. Shared objects
between the renderer and sandboxes should be put in the sandboxed memory.
The renderer is restricted to access those memory via `tainted` pointer.

##### Data Validation
RLBox requires developers to write validation functions for `tainted` data.

When tainted data are in sandbox memory, TOCTOU attacks are possible. To prevent
such attacks, RLBox provides an API `copyAndVerify(verify_fn, arg)` to copy
`arg` into renderer memory before validation.

RLBox proposes two styles of writing validators:
- Maintaining application invariants
- Checking library invariants

#### Control Flow Safety
The renderer cannot directly use `tainted` control data, e.g., branching on a
`tainted` variable, but malicious lib code can divert control flow via callback
functions. RLBox provides an API `sandbox_callback()` for developers to register
callback functions. All arguments to a callback function should be `tainted`.

> Specifically, RLBox automatically replaces each Firefox callback passed to
  libjpeg with a pointer to a trampoline function and tracks the mapping between
  the two. When the trampoline function is invoked, RLBox invokes the
  appropriate Firefox callback on libjpegâ€™s behalf.

(The quoted content is in Section 4.2 but "Control flow safety" is Section 4.4.)

### What are the strengths of this paper?
- Very fine-grained sandboxing: RLBox not only prevents the sandboxed code from
  accessing renderer's memory, but also enforces many other restrictions such as
  which callback functions in the renderers can be invoked.
- Strong evaluation.
- Solved problems in a real-world popular software, and the work was indeed
  adopted in production code.

### What are the limitations and weaknesses of this paper?
- The programmer effort seem moderate.
- Performance and memory overhead are moderate.

### What makes this paper publishable?
- Thorough and robust protection for Firefox renderer against errors in
  libraries.

### What are other solutions and what are the most relevant works?

### Thing(s) that I like particularly about this paper.

### What is the take-away message from this paper?

### Other comments
- Some operations, such as rewriting certain lib functions calls, seems that can
be automatically transformed by the compiler. If so, why did not RLBox do it?

- The engineering effort required to pull off this project is tremendous.
