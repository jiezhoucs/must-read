### What problem this paper tried to solve?
The semantics of SC atomic accesses in C11 is flawed in that two suggested
compilation schemes (with and without fences) are unsound. As a result,
behaviors disallowed by C11 are allowed on Power.

- the SC semantics are too strong for Power, leading to disallowed behavior.
- The SC-fences are too weak on Power, leading to disallowed behavior.
- the out-of-thin-air problem is possible.

### Why is the problem important?
With current semantics of SC atomic accesses in C11, undefined behaviors are 
possible, leading to broken semantics of a program.

### What is this paper's solution to the problem?
They proposed a model called R11 with a better semantics for SC accesses.

- weakens the `hb` relation of SC events. 
- strengthen SC-fences
- disallow `(su U rf)` cycles.

This new semantics:
- ensures soundness of the compilation schemes to Power
- maintains the DRF-SC guarantees
- provides stronger, more useful guarantees to SC fences.
